# Secure Payment Gateway

This project is a secure and formal payment gateway solution, designed for seamless integration into your website.

## Features

- **HTML Frontend**: User-friendly and formal interface for entering billing and payment details.
- **CSS Styling**: Provides a professional look and feel.
- **JavaScript Validation**: Client-side validation ensures data accuracy.
- **PHP Backend**: Validates and processes payment details, ready for integration with payment gateways.

## Files Included

1. `index.html`: The main HTML file for the payment form.
2. `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the page.
3. `scripts.js`: JavaScript file for client-side validation and interactivity.
4. `process_payment.php`: PHP script for backend validation and payment processing.

## Installation

1. **Download the package** and extract its contents.
2. Place all files in your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
3. Ensure PHP is installed and properly configured on your server.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the payment form.
2. Fill in the required details and submit the form.
3. The PHP script will process the inputs and simulate payment processing.

## Notes

- Replace the simulated payment logic in `process_payment.php` with actual integration to a payment gateway like PayPal, Stripe, etc.
- Secure your server with HTTPS for encrypted data transmission.
- Add server-side measures like CSRF protection and secure database handling as needed.
